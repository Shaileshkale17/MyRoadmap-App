## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React.js, Redux (for state management), React Router, Axios (for API calls)
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB (with Mongoose)
- **Authentication**: JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for user authentication
- **Deployment**: vercal (for the backend), vercal (for the frontend)
